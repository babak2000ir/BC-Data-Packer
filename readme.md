This is a simple data packer, this app deivers BC data for test and reasearch, like AI cases. 
**AI Hackathon**

there is a page: Searchable Tables when you install it in BC. You can set tables, fields and some AI Guide on general level, table level or fields level. This outputs a webservice. I installed it on my personal BC account, we don't have licnese for that on AI HAckathon's subscription! :/
